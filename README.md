### **Description**
This app has a database of different produce from a local farmer. As a browser, people are able to see a list of produce and products available for sale, and details about each one.

If they choose to make an account and login, they will then gain the ability to place an order (consisting of the products they choose and a location/date they will pick out of available choices), view any of their previous orders, and update and delete any open orders.
